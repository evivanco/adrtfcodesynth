    "status": "Accepted",
    "motivation": "The current monolithic architecture limits scalability, maintainability, and resilience. As the application grows, these limitations hinder the ability to efficiently manage and scale the system. Transitioning to a microservices architecture allows for independent scaling, improved fault isolation, and better alignment with modern software development practices.",

    ],
    "main_decision": "The decision is to decompose the existing monolithic application into a set of loosely coupled microservices. Each microservice will be independently deployable and focused on a specific business capability. This transition will involve identifying and isolating components that can be refactored into services, implementing service communication through APIs, and adopting a decentralized data management approach.",

    "consequences": "The transition to microservices will enhance scalability, maintainability, and resilience in the long term.
